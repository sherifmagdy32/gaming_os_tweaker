# HIDDEN GUIDE

## General

I noticed before some players seeming to be too responsive in a manner that would be like they were in advantage or too much desync happening for a specific player, like bullets just not hitting point blank, when in movement, but never quite got to understand how. This could be it.

> You dont need to move to Russla, just install a netem linux packet and delay packets at your router. 100 percent vac/AC safe, and legit. And as a bonus, you can delay the packets at only one direction (outgoing only) to see them instantly but forcing others to be behind you up to 200ms. And as a bonus of bonus - you can do it only at T side which is more lag-favouring. I tested it in DM and it was like wallhack, they DONT react, its like a drug, very addictive  But still didnt have enough Putinity to start it at faceit.

Could also be due to network buffering <https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10426>

> It would be great if this was dealt or at least mitigated by the game developers.
